# odin-recipes
Project for Odin
This project aims to create a webage that will resemble a recipe website.
 
By completing this project I will show an understanding of writing basic HTML,
how to properly format text, display images, and create hyperlinks both 
realtive and absolute.
I will also demonstrate forward thinking workflow by creating useful commit 
messages in addition to properly nesting both my files and my lines of code
